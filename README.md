# Project-06
 An analog clock is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling the clock face and hands, and JavaScript to calculate and animate the hand rotations based on the current time. The clock updates in real-time by adjusting the angles of the hands, creating a functional and visually appealing timepiece.
